Dickey-Fuller Test Results Analysis
The Dickey-Fuller test results has shown span multiple iterations, and each provides specific insights about the stationarity of the time series data:

P-Values:

Many of the tests have p-values above the conventional 0.05 threshold (e.g., 0.447446, 0.140974), suggesting that you fail to reject the null hypothesis, and the time series could be non-stationary.
However, there are instances (p-value = 0.001865, 2.786556e-08) where the p-value is significantly low, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting the series is stationary.

Test Statistic vs. Critical Values:
In most cases, the test statistic is not more negative than the critical values for 1%, 5%, and 10% significance levels. This result typically supports the non-stationarity of the series.
In a few tests, the test statistic is more negative than at least one of the critical values, suggesting potential stationarity, particularly noticeable in the results where the test statistic is -3.924031 and -6.338871.

AutoCorrelation Graph Analysis
The autocorrelation plot shows that there is a significant autocorrelation at initial lags which gradually tapers off but remains positive. This suggests:

Seasonality or Trend Components: The data might contain seasonal effects or trends that have not been adjusted for, which might be influencing the autocorrelation.
AutoRegression Model Performance
From plots and results:

In-Fold Predictions: Show the model capturing some dynamics but possibly also capturing noise, as indicated by high variability in predictions compared to actual values.
Out-of-Fold Predictions: Demonstrate smoother predictions but still with some deviation from actuals, reflecting potential overfitting to training data or underfitting complexities in the data.

SMAPE Error
199.19799168002112% Error in Test: This unusually high SMAPE value suggests that the predictions are often quite far from the actual values, or there could be instances where both predicted and actual values are close to zero, which inflates SMAPE significantly.


ARIMA Model Analysis
Visuals: The ARIMA model seems to capture some of the variability in the data, as seen in the training predictions. However, it struggles with peaks, which may indicate that extreme values or outliers affect its performance.
Errors: The SMAPE values of 55.93% in training and 44.58% in testing indicate that while the model is somewhat effective, it does have significant prediction errors, particularly in capturing the peaks accurately.

LSTM Model Analysis
Visuals: LSTM predictions show better alignment with the actual data trends, especially in the training phase. The smoother lines in the prediction plots suggest it's capturing the general trends but might be smoothing over some important fluctuations.
Errors: MSE of 0.0826 in training and 0.0948 in testing is quite reasonable for many practical applications, suggesting that LSTM handles noise and potential non-linearities in the data effectively.

XG Boost
Errors: A train error of 3.92% and a significantly higher test error of 69.94% suggest overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize effectively to unseen data.
Prophet Model Analysis (Based on Seasonality and Trend Decomposition)
Visuals: The Prophet model shows a clear seasonal pattern and a downtrend, which might be valuable for forecasting if seasonality is a key component of the data structure. The ability to capture daily or weekly patterns is a strong point of Prophet, useful in many practical forecasting tasks.
Trend Analysis: The decreasing trend line suggests that whatever metric forecasting is on a downward trajectory over the periods analyzed. Weekly seasonality shows that certain days (like mid-week) could have higher values than others (like weekends).

General Observations
Complexity of Data: Your data shows clear periodic peaks which all models struggle with to some extent. This could be indicative of underlying phenomena like seasonal sales, user activity spikes, or similar events.
Model Fit: ARIMA and LSTM show reasonable fit but have their limitations, especially with peak predictions. LSTM seems to handle general trends better, while ARIMA is sensitive to peak anomalies. XGBoost shows overfitting, which could be mitigated by tuning its parameters or using regularization techniques.
Model Selection: Depending on the ultimate goal of the analysis (e.g., understanding underlying trends vs. making the most accurate predictions possible), different models might be preferable. LSTM offers a good balance for complex patterns and non-linear relationships typical in many practical scenarios.

Recommendations
Further Tuning: For LSTM and XGBoost, consider hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance. For ARIMA, investigate additional differencing or a more robust error model to better handle peaks.
Feature Engineering: Adding lagged variables, rolling averages, or other transformations could help improve model performance, especially for peak prediction.
Model Ensemble: Sometimes combining predictions from multiple models (ensemble methods) can help to mitigate the weaknesses of individual models, improving overall prediction accuracy.
