Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Data is loaded from compressed CSV files using a custom function load_data that handles zip compression and optional date parsing.
A language feature is extracted from the 'Page' column, showcasing data manipulation and feature engineering skills.
Data is transformed into a long format suitable for time series analysis, specifically for handling time-indexed data in models like ARIMA and LSTM.
Statistical Analysis:

Initial exploratory data analysis includes calculating rolling statistics and visualizing these along with the original data to assess trends and volatility.
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is applied to assess the stationarity of the time series, critical for models like ARIMA that require stationary data.
Time Series Forecasting Models:

ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average): Used for modeling time series data that needs differencing to become stationary. It includes model fitting, forecasting, and plotting predictions against actual data.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks): A deep learning approach for sequential data, demonstrating data normalization, network architecture setup, model training, prediction, and performance evaluation using MSE.
XGBoost: Demonstrates an ensemble learning approach to handle regression tasks within time series data. Involves feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
Evaluation Metrics:

Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) are calculated to evaluate the forecasting accuracy and model performance.
Plots are used extensively to visualize the actual versus predicted values, providing a clear visual assessment of model performance.
Prophet: Utilized for capturing seasonal patterns and trends in the data. Prophet is particularly noted for its robust handling of daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality.

Real-World Data Challenges
Non-Stationarity: Many real-world datasets are non-stationary, making models like ARIMA less effective unless the data is differenced or transformed.
Outliers and Noise: Real-world data often contain outliers or noise that can significantly affect the predictions of sensitive models like ARIMA and LSTM.
Seasonality: Handling complex seasonal patterns that might not be captured fully by traditional methods without extensive tuning or feature engineering.
Recommendations for Real-Life Scenarios
Data Preprocessing: Emphasize robust preprocessing steps including detrending, deseasonalizing, and outlier treatment to prepare data for more accurate modeling.
Model Selection: Choose the model based on the data characteristics:
ARIMA for simpler seasonal patterns.
LSTM for complex patterns where relationships might not just be linear.
Prophet for datasets where multiple seasonality patterns and holidays impact trends.
Model Tuning and Validation: Implement rigorous cross-validation techniques to ensure models do not overfit. Tuning hyperparameters, especially in models like LSTM and XGBoost, can significantly enhance performance.
Hybrid Models: Consider combining forecasts from several models to balance out their individual weaknesses.
Deployment Considerations: In deployment, set up a pipeline for continuous training and model updating as new data becomes available. Use automated monitoring systems to detect performance drift.
